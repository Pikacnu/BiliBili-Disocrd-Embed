In usecase the longer video have less possible generate embed by one time
If it doesn't work just change parms(This website don't take any parms) let discord reload embed

# Important
`index.ts` can be run in most envrionment
`linux.ts` only can be run on linux(I test it on ubuntu server) and not statble but support stream
